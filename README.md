# 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

This project includes both **Regression** and **Classification** algorithms to compare performance across different learning paradigms.

---

# 📈 Regression Models

The following regression algorithms were implemented:

| Model | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Linear Regression | Linear | Baseline regression |
| Ridge Regression | Linear + Regularization | Reduce overfitting |
| Decision Tree Regressor | Tree-Based | Capture non-linear relationships |
| Random Forest Regressor | Ensemble | Improve stability & accuracy |
| Support Vector Regressor (SVR) | Kernel-Based | High-dimensional regression |
| XGBoost Regressor | Boosting | High-performance prediction |

---

## Why These Regression Models?

Regression models were selected to compare:

- Linear vs non-linear learning
- Simple vs ensemble approaches
- Bagging vs boosting
- Predictive power on tabular datasets

### Model Selection Justification

### Linear Regression
Used as a simple and interpretable baseline model.

### Ridge Regression
Chosen to reduce overfitting using regularization.

### Decision Tree Regressor
Selected to learn complex non-linear patterns.

### Random Forest Regressor
Chosen due to ensemble robustness and reduced variance.

### SVR
Used to evaluate kernel-based learning capability.

### XGBoost
Selected because of strong predictive performance and boosting architecture.

---

# 📊 Classification Models

The following classification models were trained:

| Model | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | Linear | Baseline classifier |
| Decision Tree Classifier | Tree-Based | Rule-based learning |
| Random Forest Classifier | Ensemble | Robust classification |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | Margin-Based | High-dimensional classification |

---

## Why These Classification Models?

These models were selected to compare:

- Linear vs non-linear decision boundaries
- Ensemble learning
- Interpretability vs performance
- Different classification strategies

### Logistic Regression
Used as an interpretable baseline classification model.

### Decision Tree
Chosen for learning non-linear rules.

### Random Forest
Selected for strong classification performance and stability.

### Support Vector Machine
Used for effective high-dimensional classification.

---

# ⚙️ Data Preprocessing Workflow

A structured preprocessing pipeline was applied where required.

## Step 1 — Data Cleaning

- Duplicate removal
- Data type verification
- Missing value identification

## Step 2 — Missing Value Handling

Different techniques were used depending on data type.

### Numerical Features
- Median imputation

### Categorical Features
- Mode imputation

### High Missing Columns
Columns with excessive missing values were removed when necessary.

---

## Step 3 — Encoding

Categorical variables were encoded to make them suitable for machine learning models.

---

## Step 4 — Train-Test Split

Datasets were divided into:

- 80% Training Data
- 20% Testing Data

This ensured fair and unbiased model evaluation.

---

# 🏗 Feature Engineering

Feature engineering was performed when required.

---

## Student Performance Dataset

A new feature:

`pass_fail`

was created using math score.

### Rule

- Math Score ≥ 50 → Pass (1)
- Math Score < 50 → Fail (0)

---

## Why Pass/Fail Was Created?

The original math score is continuous and suitable for regression.

However, academic systems often evaluate outcomes through binary decisions such as:

- Pass / Fail
- Qualified / Not Qualified

Creating this feature allowed:

- Conversion into a classification problem
- Binary outcome prediction
- Educational outcome analysis

---

## Why Pass_Fail Was Used as Target?

The `pass_fail` feature represents the final academic outcome.

It was selected as the target variable because it allows machine learning models to learn patterns associated with student success and failure.

---

# 📏 Evaluation Metrics

Different evaluation metrics were used depending on problem type.

---

# Regression Metrics

| Metric | Purpose |
|---|---|
| MAE | Average prediction error |
| RMSE | Penalizes larger prediction errors |
| R² Score | Measures explained variance |

---

# Classification Metrics

| Metric | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | Overall prediction correctness |
| F1 Score | Balance between precision and recall |
| ROC-AUC | Classification ranking performance |

Multiple metrics were used to ensure reliable evaluation.
